Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\n\n## Code scaffolding\n\nRun `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.\n\n## Build\n\nRun `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.\n\n## Running unit tests\n\nRun `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).\n\n## Running end-to-end tests\n\nRun `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.\n\n## Further help\n\nTo get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.dev/tools/cli) page.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","gitHead":"3b23d7c9211bd5705fe21a3e8a9f5d8ede9cdccf","description":"This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.1.2.","_nodeVersion":"20.18.2","_npmVersion":"10.8.2","dist":{"integrity":"sha512-nH+v94S4sZJxo9lB5lx2q5qrB06T/9jua1+5BfQL9+dR0JPDtiAaob6WdWivk0cByj7tXUElWlv0eel56/sm0w==","shasum":"b5c7f5b179647e16b4e4a076befecd777630dffb","tarball":"http://localhost:8081/repository/angular-pack/web-angular/-/web-angular-0.0.0.tgz"}}},"access":null,"_rev":"1","time":{"created":"2025-01-31T05:31:15.812Z","modified":"2025-01-31T05:31:15.812Z","0.0.0":"2025-01-31T05:31:15.812Z"}}
